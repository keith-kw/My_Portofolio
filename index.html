                            this project is able to create a website is by using ASP.NET and Domain Driven Design (DDD) method for developing the website and
                            also using SAP Crystal Report for the Transaction Report. This website can be accessed by 3 roles, which are Member that can buy and
                            view the menu and access the purchase history. Staff can handle the Member order, and insert, update and delete the ramen, and also view
                            all the customer list. Also, Admin have both Member and Staff privilege, and view all the transaction reports. On the transaction history
                            when the user click the detail button it will redirect to the transaction detail page using URL Query String. The challenges while working on
                            this project are making sure the the view on the Crystal report is correct and also applying the DDD method correctly, which I as the
